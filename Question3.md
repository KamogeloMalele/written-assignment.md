In my free time, I enjoy:

•	Talking to God (i.e., reading the bible and other religious works);

•	Reading history and advancements in science and technology;

•	Gardening;

•	Watching animation and comedy;

•	Finding and completing activities for professional development;

•	Talking to friends and family;

•	Listening to music and playing my guitar.
