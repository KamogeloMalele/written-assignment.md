The exchange of information and the potential it has, whether written or spoken, for the advancement of customer satisfaction. The relationship between us (i.e., Capitec Bank) and clients is ever-growing and retaining their trust is imperative not only through clear communication but also in helping them achieve their lifetime goals. More can be learnt and achieved by adapting the information we give and the conversations we have with clients (i.e., via app, branch, USSD or call). What fascinates me is the work that happens behind each message, push notification, pop-up and the integration of it all on one system. Based on what Iâ€™ve learnt about the 4IR and self-study on coding languages (specifically C++), developing skills in this area would be of great benefit. Not only will I contribute to the sustainability of the institution, but I will have the opportunity to share my ideas with like-minded individuals for the betterment of clients as well.
