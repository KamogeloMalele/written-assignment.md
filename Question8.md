I aim to ameliorate the growing concern of illiteracy and crime in my community. Although social platforms are used to communicate about these issues, minimal change has been seen over the years. I aim to start with illiteracy among school-going children and make way to the working class. Failing a grade has been seen as the norm, and from what I was told by my previous educators, pass rates have dropped along with the school rankings. More young children get involved in gangsterism. That is one of a few things I aim to correct by sharing information and change the townâ€™s identity alongside community members. For my family, it means encouraging my members to strive towards their dreams irrespective of the level of adversity. I will become a Software Engineer in the next six years. I will become fluent in two coding languages in the next two years.
