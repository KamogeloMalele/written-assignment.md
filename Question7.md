My routine involves dividing coursework by assignment due dates. Once the dates have been set, my calendar is laid out as follows:

•	Allocate two days before the assignment due date to check errors and missed points before submission.

•	Allocate a week to complete a chapter. Work through a maximum of three short chapters on weekdays.

•	Assign one week for revision of the previous week’s work and go through any additional readings, plus quizzes.

•	When half of the coursework is covered, take a week off to relax and avoid burning out.
