I am one of three breadwinners at home. I contribute a quarter of my salary towards my family's needs. I live away from them, but I make time to visit once a month. If I skip a month or two without visiting, I spend two to five days with them when on leave. I am not married, nor do I have children, so this gives me the flexibility to travel.
