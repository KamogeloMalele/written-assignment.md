For starters, my name is Kamogelo Malele. I was born and raised in Wattville, a small township located in Benoni. I spent most of my school life in Benoni before completing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Environmental Health through the University of Johannesburg in 2022. Short courses in computer literacy and health science followed this.



I chose Environmental Health because of the potential impact I could bring to public health. However, I noticed other areas of community life that need addressing. The areas were information transparency, access and computer literacy in the rural and urban areas of the Gauteng and Limpopo provinces. Regarding Limpopo, I conducted Community Service under the Limpopo Department of Health, where I served eight health institutions. Irrespective of the financial and administrative constraints faced by the Van Velden Hospital team, we managed to cover critical areas in one year. This taught me to be resourceful, a problem solver and an analyst.



My loving parents passed down their values for education and social cohesion. Although they do not have a complete formal education past grade 10, their resilience and growth give me the courage to be dependable and open to helping anyone in need. That is what brought me to Capitec Bank.
