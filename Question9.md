I still have time to work on the other areas that rely on my success if I do not manage to launch my career in my twenties or early thirties. It would be slower than what it could have been; however, I will still strive towards their fulfilment as this would change the landscape of the current state of Wattville and my life. If time is the main method of measuring success, and my attempts keep failing, I will try to switch between my goals to achieve others before the one I was focused on. I believe with God's grace, I will find my true path. I must open my ears to hear His guidance.
