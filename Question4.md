I do not have formal training in coding as yet; however, I had planned to close the year with two entry-level certificates. I aim to advance from then with the prospect to create interactive interfaces suitable for light gaming, data framing and automation. Outside of this scope, I have learnt to listen actively and speak succinctly. Previously, I managed a large workload that included the submission of weekly reports of investigation findings conducted on eight health institutions in 2023 under the Limpopo Department of Health. At the same time, I participated in a pilot study focused on addressing hygiene needs in my jurisdiction over the year. This included work conducted on Microsoft Excel and adjusting spreadsheets for relevant data. I did computer literacy in 2019 and have worked with Microsoft 365 and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (or SPSS). I am still sharpening my coding skills and on route to achieve an entry-level C++ certificate.
